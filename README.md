# Guess-the-random-number
This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and the player must guess it.
After each guess, the program provides a hint until the number is not equal:

"Higher number please" if the guess is low

"Lower number please" if the guess is high

The game ends when the player guesses the number correctly, and the program displays the total number of attempts.

# How to run
1. Save the script to a file, for example: **guessing_game.py**
2. Run it using: **python guessing_game.py**
